Ask four questions:

1. What are the business goals of the site?
	Educate user
	explain why they should take action

2. What are the user goals for the page?
	what benefits do they get?
	figure out what this is

3. What are the questions the user needs to answer in order to accomplish their goals?
	What do they get?
	Why do they need this?
	What happens next?

4. What emotions that we want to invoke?
	Assurance
	Relief
	Confidence

Who are you wanting to connect with?
What are the problems they're experiencing?
